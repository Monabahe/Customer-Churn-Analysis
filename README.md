# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Customer Churn Analysis** project aims to understand and visualize the churn rate among customers, identify the reasons behind customer churn, and provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard. The analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, leveraging its powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities. Additionally, the Power Query Editor is used for data cleaning and establishing connections.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Power Query Editor**: For data cleaning and connection.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Collection
- Gathered customer data from various sources (e.g., databases, CSV files).
- Consolidated the data into a single Excel workbook for easy handling.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Imported the data into the Power Query Editor.
- Performed data cleaning tasks including:
  - Removing duplicates.
  - Handling missing values.
  - Correcting data types.
- Established data connections and combined multiple data sources into a cohesive dataset.

### 3. Data Analysis
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Analyzed various metrics related to customer churn such as:
  - Churn rate.
  - Customer demographics.
  - Customer Behaviour.
  - Interaction history.
- Identified key factors contributing to customer churn.

### 4. Data Visualization
- Created visual representations of the data using Excel's charting tools.
- Developed various charts and graphs including:
  - Bar charts to show churn rate across different demographics.
  - Line charts to display trends over time.
  - Pie charts to illustrate the proportion of churned vs retained customers.
  - Scatter chart

### 5. Building the Dashboard
- Designed an interactive dashboard in Excel to present the analysis findings.
- Included key metrics and visualizations to provide a comprehensive overview of customer churn.
- Utilized slicers and pivot tables to enable dynamic filtering and drill-down capabilities.

### 6. Insights and Recommendations
- Summarized the findings from the analysis.
- Provided insights into the reasons behind customer churn.
- Suggested actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of customer churn, utilizing Excel and Power Query Editor to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. The final dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to understand churn patterns and make informed decisions to enhance customer retention strategies.
